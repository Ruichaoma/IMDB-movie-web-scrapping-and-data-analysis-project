API credential: I use omdb library wrapper as API source. My API key is 6de2ae04. I also write them in my code(data_source_two.py)
And here is website where I download omdb library wrapper:https://pypi.org/project/omdb/, then click 'download files' and download both of them
I also download imdb api library wrapper. Where address is https://pypi.org/project/IMDbPY/. then click 'download files' and download both of them
I use imdb library only for extracting top 250 rated movie list. Main API in my data_source_two is omdb.
how do I generate omdb API key: using this email:ruichaom@usc.edu to register.
For imdb dataset, it seems like I can directly use after I download it. No API key is required.
(But still, my registered email for imdb api is ruichaom@usc.edu with password Syy0508177, probably this is not necessary)
